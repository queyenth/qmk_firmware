# Just my small libs to share across my keyboards
## Callum-mode
slightly changed, playing around with callum-mode-style layers also
## Lang
Just a small thingy to change the language in system & keyboard, also a small program to sync the input between wayland and keyboard. No support for windows/os x/xorg, as I don't use it. Maybe will add support for the Xorg.
